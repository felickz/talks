# Talk Outline
Create a talk outline with detailed notes on how to present in an effective and engaging way.

## Introduce of Self

### Structure
I do ___ and what I love ___

- Adding what you love to do adds a human reaction - you will naturally smile and be more humanized

### Example

Hi, I am Chad Bentz I work at GitHub in Field Security and I LOVE working with cutting edge technology - being at GitHub allows me to geek out on that every day.


## Introducing the topic - THE HOOK

- Who + What + Why = hook
- More impactful if more concisce
- Use accessible language (explain it to grandma) - dont overuse words that are not common - speak right to the center

### Who (not overtly)
- Who is the audience
  - What do they care about
    -  Ex: Leadership - be breif/ be bright / be gone
    -   Brief
    -   Bottom line
    -   BE READY TO DRILL DOWN
  - What would they want to get out of this meeting


### What - the HOOK

- INCLUDE THE BENEFIT
  - Showcase X so they can understand Y
  - Find the "core human desire" that matches what they would want
    - Faster / Easier
      - "Today I am going to show you a tool to not only do you job better, to get better decisions"

- A Joke gets more laughs if the punchline at the end
  - A Hook gets better when you put the benefit at the end
    -  "SO THAT - you cand do X"
       -  "SO THAT YOU HAVE THE HEALTH OF BUSINESS AT YOUR FINGERTIPS
    -  Add adjectives / superlatives .. "the best" "the fastest" "the most efficient"

- Interweve this into most every slide (even a screenshot)
  - "So that you can do X"
  - "So that you can have Y"

### WHY


## STORY

Telling a story is an example

- IF YOU ARE NOT A STORY TELLER - think "Example" .. and you will procede to tell a story
  - Ask yourself "Do i have a good example of this" - and then put into the structure

- Telling a story stimulates the brain like the listener is experiencing it!

- Make sure the moral of the story matches the takeaway you want to give

- A data point is much mor powerful when it is wrapped in a story

### Format
- The Situation (The example)
- The Problem ( What is problematic)
- The Solution (relevant details listed out)
- The Benefit/Acheivement (Answer "what are they now able to achive")

### Frietag's Pyramid
- Start with the situation
- Build up with the problem
- Climax with the solution
- come back down with the acheivement

Make sure the story has these 4 things - OFTEN leave out one of these
- Situation
- Problem
- Solution
- Acheivement

### Emotion Words
DONT UNDERSELL THE PROBLEM - the bigger the problem the bigger the solution

Include emotinal words
- "I was so frustrated"
- "I was safe and secure"
- "I was terrified"

### Details - Paint the picture

- If it doesnt add to the story - leave it out

# Slides
- less text
- more images

# Talk Delivery

## Voice

- Confidence - the choices you make on stage communicate to the audience
  - Analogy: A pilot that delivers an announcement that is not reassuring might make you get off the plane
  - If you are a speaker, you are the captain and the audience are the passengers for your journey
  - USE the below to APPEAR more confident even if you are not as prepared (audience doesnt need to know this)

- Dont get caught up in trying to get the audience to feel like you are amazing
  - want them to feel like they are in good hands
    - invited
    - comfortable
    - safe

PRACTICE THESE THINGS!!

- What should you DO differently?
  - Smile = warmth
    - culturally we smile when we meet each other
    - It changes the tone of your delivery to be warmer (uncounciously)
  - Eye contact
    - It doesnt have to be real to APPEAR like you are making eye contact
    - In the intro, look more generally at the horizon line or betweeen peoples heads - start out with the intro that way
    - Look right into the camera even if it is nothing to look at
  - Posture - like super hero
    - sit like super hero
    - open body posture (dont cross arms)
    - dont do the pee pee dance and shuffle back and forth - this is sign of nervousness
    - even if you are not confident - you will look it
  - Purposful movement
    - You can walk left to ask quesiton , then walk right to ask another question from other side of the room
  - Volume = Energy
    - talk at a 5 or 6, not a 3( sounds tired)
      - Do an A / B Test - what feels comfortble vs 2 notches up
    - DO NOT SHOUT but it might FEEL like yelling
  - Pause insted of run on sentance / verbal filler


How do you FEEL more confident - IF you get nervous "its only me"
- you cannot reliably control your feelings
- WORDS HAVE POWER - even what you say to yourself
  - I am nervous about going in front of leadership
  - -> I am excited about sharing my ideas with leadership
  - -> I have a big burst of addrenaline about sharing my ideas with leadership
- you can say silently to yourself in your own mind - while others are introducing you
  - say to yourself "in invite you to be here with me so i can help you to the best of my ability"
  - say "i am here because i know there is that one person in the audience that needs to hear this" = my purpose
- Say the intro to yourself when you are driving
- Remind yourself you got this, and deliver the talk to the best of your ability

Interactivity
- This is never a lecture
- People learn better through play
- A trivia quiz, invite someone else on stage to do a demo
- dont just raise a hand


- Me
  - Instill confidence by being real
  - Sound authentic
  - Not a sales pitch
  - Slow and confidnet delivery

## Hints
- Written script is not the same as spoken word, starting from written word and delivering it as spoken word can be awkward.  Practice speaking the words out loud and craft the below as hints.
- Use bullets, the shortest form that is glanceable and easy to remember
- Dont spend the majority of your time on the slide deck, spend majority of the time practicing out loud to have a fluid delivery (turn up the energy and take out the filler words)
- Filler words - a FEW are fine but too many can be distracting
  - AWARENESS - record yourself and listen to it
  - Add in a breath instead of a filler word - "pause" might make your hold your breath
  - Can help when you are speaking to quickly - SLOW DOWN might be a bad thing if you delivering like a slow robot
- How do you regain your footing when you feel like you haven’t come across as clear and concise and don’t have the engagement you want from your audience?
  - You cant always translate blank stares into "they are not interested" ... you cant control this
  - Double down on invitation to the audience as a mindset shift - in your head say to yourself "I invite you to be here with me so i can help you to the best of my ability" ... INVITE + HELP


## Practicing
- Stand up / Join a zoom
- Say out loud
- Each time pick one thing to improve on
  - Reduce filler words (likes and umms)

## Resources
- www.speeko.co has been a great app for me to rehearse talks and receive feedback on tempo and umms
- The book Wordslut has a really interesting chapter on filler words
